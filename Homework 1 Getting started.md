# Homework 1: Getting started

### 1. Notes for Lesson 1

- **Sequencing and Computing:** 
  - Sequencing: revolution of sequencing power, nanopore (not so accurate)
  - Computing : data problems v.s. biology problems

 - **"Algorithm" and "Model"**

   **Algorithm** is a program to instruct machines to solve a problem step by step. Data can be fed into a written algorithm, and it will output results following the given approaches. It can be compared to the way how human teach machines to process and interpret massive input data, by giving machines a feasible stepwise protocol.

   **Model** is closer to a product of an algorithm,  a summarized conclusion from data. It could be  in the form of mathematical expressions or a judgement rule. Based on a model, we can make prodictions and judgements on a given input. In other words, algorithm is provided for the learning process and the establishment of the model, and model is the learning result, a rule which can be utilized directly for the generation of a conclusion upon data input. For instance, an algorithm could be the process of linear regression and a model is the function expression of the linear regression result and could be used for the prediction of variants.

 - **"Science" and "Technology"**

   **Technology:** Robot, Nanotech, Genetics

   **Science:** consciousness, number of genes, genetics and health

 - **The Genome:** 

   - Genes: not DNA/RNA, but information
   - What is in the noncoding region?



### 2. Study Plans

Here are a few things that I expect to do during this course.

- **Algorithms**

  - Try to comprehend algorithmic principles of various tools

- **Statistics**

  - Learn statistic basis of bioinformatic algorithms
  - Discriminate between correct and wrong statistic application in data analysis

- **Methods**

  - Learn where and how to find answers to bioinformatic problems, i.e., GitHub 
  - Practice and gain programming skills

- **Tools**

  - Generally knowing useful tools for different biological problems

  - Comparison between tools and choose appropriate tools for given problems

- **More Application to Real Data**

  - Apply methods to data generated from my experiments in lab
  - Understand the principles of tools and more freely explore data interpretation
  - Find true biological effects from massive data and distinguish between good and bad results
